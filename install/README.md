# Installation

 Before you run the first script you must set the network config by hand.
 There are two options: The wired static network or the wifi (wifi-menu).
 The process is described [here](https://github.com/josem-amatriain/archlinux.install#installing-network-manual-mode)

 * The ```install1.sh``` script makes the BASIC INSTALL.
 * The ```install2.sh``` script makes the system bootable after the chroot command.

The etc directory contains the config.sh file with the basics and self-explanatory parameters needed for the basic configuration.
The ```install1.sh``` script contains ```read x``` instructions to see step by step the correct execution.
